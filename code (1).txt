# Simple Web-Based English Speaking Practice Tool

This tool allows users to practice their English speaking skills using only browser technologies. It utilizes the Web Speech API for voice recognition and speech synthesis.

## Features

*   **Voice Recognition**: Captures user's spoken English using `SpeechRecognition`.
*   **Text Display**: Shows the transcribed text in a chat-like interface.
*   **Spoken Responses**: Uses `SpeechSynthesis` to read out predefined responses or repeat/acknowledge user's speech.
*   **Basic Grammar Correction**: Implements very simple, rule-based grammar correction for common mistakes.
*   **Unlimited Conversation**: Users can continue the conversation as long as they wish.
*   **Browser-Only**: No backend, API keys, or external servers required. Runs entirely in the client's browser.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   Web Speech API:
    *   `SpeechRecognition` (for Speech-to-Text)
    *   `SpeechSynthesis` (for Text-to-Speech)

## How to Run

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   Download the ZIP of this project and extract it.
    *   OR Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>` (if it were in a repo)

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    *   Navigate to the project folder.
    *   Open the `index.html` file directly in a modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge). Firefox support for `SpeechRecognition` might require enabling flags or might be partial.

3.  **Grant Microphone Access:**
    *   When you first click "Start Talking", your browser will prompt you for permission to use your microphone. You **must** allow this for the tool to work.

4.  **Start Practicing:**
    *   Click the "Start Talking" button.
    *   Speak clearly into your microphone.
    *   The tool will transcribe your speech, display it, and provide a spoken response.
    *   The "Start Talking" button will re-enable for your next turn.

## Browser Compatibility

*   **Speech Recognition (`SpeechRecognition`)**:
    *   Best support in **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge**.
    *   Firefox has experimental support, often requiring flags to be enabled (`media.webspeech.recognition.enable` in `about:config`) and may not be as robust.
    *   Safari has support but might have different implementation nuances.
*   **Speech Synthesis (`speechSynthesis`)**:
    *   Widely supported in modern browsers.

If you encounter issues, please ensure you are using an up-to-date version of a compatible browser and have granted microphone permissions.

## Known Limitations & Potential Improvements

*   **Grammar Correction**: The current grammar correction is very basic and rule-based. It only catches a few predefined common errors.
*   **Natural Language Understanding**: There's no sophisticated NLU. Responses are based on simple keyword matching.
*   **Voice Variety**: Voice selection for speech synthesis is basic; it tries to find a female US English voice but might fall back to browser defaults.
*   **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place, but could be more comprehensive.
*   **Contextual Conversation**: The bot does not maintain conversation context beyond the immediate turn.
